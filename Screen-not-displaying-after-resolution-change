So at the hospital, I changed the resolution of the monitor and the display stopped working. Seems the resolution I picked wasn't supported by the monitor. 
Without the display, how can I fix this?

The easiest way was to;
Boot the PC into safe mode.

And open Device Manager;
Windows Key + R 
Type devmgmt.msc 

Once the device manager is open. 
You look for the display adapters. 
The uninstall it, 
Boot the PC back to normal mode. 
It will take sometime to display, because windows will build a new display driver, a rollback driver.
